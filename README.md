Fluenza_ Â» Repository full of projects/yaml!
===========
##About
Welcome to *Fluenza_'s* repository. All of my past, present and future projects will be located here!. I plan to develop **useful** programs and/or plugins from time to time. **Planned:**

1. **YAML generator** Enter your map information, select your loadout and suddenly with a click of a button, you'll have a *working* .yaml file automaticly generated for you! Helpful to users who don't know how to code!

2. **Websites** I do plan to develop websites using *Bootstrap 3*, designing clean and responsive interfaces. 

3. **Minecraft Plugins** If you are wishing to start building a Minecraft server, a bunch of plugins **will** be stored here. Goals:
--* User friendly.
--* Effective and flexible.
--* Fully customizable.

4. **Writing YAML files manually** I do requests, yes. Please submit these via my **Skype** (*jozzeh.mc*)
